In this folder are located the code an files needed for the manipulation of the taxonomic assignation of bacterial metagenomes. In this project are being used to analyse data 
from Covid metagenomes, but this code can be expanded to any set of data that has used kraken or simil taxonomic assignation algorithm. 
  This code uses phyloseq as its main skeleton to manipulate the data and create plots. In order to use this data, the kraken.reports must be converted in biom format by a program
like kraken-biom.

This ideas and code are the contribution of Daniel Edder Bustos (thank you so much Dani, you have teached us a lot) and Nelly Selem Mojica (arigatou sensei for all your support).
