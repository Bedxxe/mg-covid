In this folder there are located code for processing metagenomic information from raw reads generated by platforms like ilumina.

Inside the folder 'raw-code' there is the code that is used to process microbiome plant sequences from coraloid roots of cycads, our research system, it is
based in algorithms and knowledge used in diverse reasearch projects that process a myraid of metagenome information so it is intended to be useful in bacterila-virus microbiome process as well. This raw code was made not only with the help and guidance of Daniel Edder Bustos, also with the scaffold that he initially contrived. Thanks so much Daniel!

The folder 'example-data' contains concatenated reads (A1_1.fq.tar.gz, A1_2.fq.tar.gz; forward and reverse respectively) that can be used to try the *.sh codes 
found un the 'raw-code' folder. Also, the user will found the *.biom file that can be manipulated with the R code that is the doppelganger of the "tax-data-manipulation-phyloseq.R" but with the strings necessaty to manipulate this file.
